# Tradewind-Finance-Joins-Apparel-Sourcing-Week-
Earlier this month, representatives from Tradewind Finance attended Apparel Sourcing Week in Bangalore. The event, organized by Apparel Resources, served as a platform for retailers and brands to connect with manufacturers from around the globe that produce luxury and fast-fashion wares.  Besides connecting buyers and suppliers, the two-day event hosted speakers that discussed a range of apparel trends, such as “Reinventing Physical Retail”, “Fashion Innovation Using AI”, and “Upcycling – The New Frontier for Sustainability”.  Tradewind has been providing financing to the apparel and textile sector since the company opened its doors over two decades ago. The company has worked with apparel exporters and manufacturers located throughout Asia and in Turkey and deeply understands the needs of this type of business. Large, well-known retailers are also a part of Tradewind’s network.  Through the company’s export factoring and supply chain finance services, businesses can improve their cash flow to increase turnover and ensure their operations run smoothly.
